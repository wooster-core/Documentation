# Editing Sound with Audacity
#### Whether it’s making your audio sound nice for your upcoming presentation, or making yourself sound like a chipmunk, we can help you out.


#### Working with Existing Audio
1. Log in to the computer.
2. Plug in your flash drive.
3. Click on the Audacity icon. ![Audacity Icon](https://files.fosswire.com/2007/10/audacity.png)
>If the icon is not there, press __Command + Space Bar.__ In the Searchlight menu box that appears, type in __“Audacity”__ and press __Return/Enter.__
4. On the top-left corner of the computer screen, next to where the top bar has an Apple icon and where it says “Audacity”, select __File → Import → Audio.__ From there, you can edit.

#### Cutting Out/Deleting Sound
1. Follow steps 1-4 in **"Working with Existing Audio".**
2. **Highlighting** lets you select a specific area of the audio clip. To do this, drag your mouse and select a section of the audio. **To delete, press the Delete/Backspace Key.**

#### Adding Effects
##### Whether you want to speed up your voice or cut out white noise, here's where you should go.
1. To select the entire audio track, click on the left area of the track, where it says **“Mono/Stereo”** ***(Note:** This will depend on the file).* ![A screencap showing the action, with a handy area pointing out where to click.](https://github.com/wooster-core/Documentation/blob/master/images/image.audacity_sound.amplify.png)
2. From there, what you want to do is up to you! To access effects, such as changing speed or pitch--or even both!--click on **Effect** in the top-screen menu, to the right of the Apple icon and to the left of “Help”.
![Here's what that looks like.](https://github.com/wooster-core/Documentation/blob/master/images/image.audacity_effects.png)

##### Remove White Noise
1. For removing noise, follow the same instructions as **"Cutting Out/Deleting Sound"** on an area with the white noise you want to remove, but **do not press delete**. ![Same thing, but slightly different this time!](https://github.com/wooster-core/Documentation/blob/master/images/image.audacity_editing_noiseremoval1.png)
2. In the effects menu, select **Noise Reduction**. ![The menu is shown.](https://github.com/wooster-core/Documentation/blob/master/images/image.audacity_editing_noiseremoval2.png)
3. Click on **Get Noise Profile**. ![The button is highlighted here.](https://github.com/wooster-core/Documentation/blob/master/images/image.audacity_editing_noiseremoval3.png)
4. Once you have done that, then select the entire audio track (as seen in **step 1 of "Adding Effects"**), and click on **Noise Removal** again. ![The menu, with the full track highlighted.](https://github.com/wooster-core/Documentation/blob/master/images/image.audacity_editing_noiseremoval4.png)
5. Click on "Okay". ![Okay button shown.](https://github.com/wooster-core/Documentation/blob/master/images/image.audacity_editing_noiseremoval5.png)

#### Aligning Tracks
##### If you have recorded more than one audio file, this will help you put them side-by-side, or wherever else you would like.
1. If you have recorded more than one audio file or track, then your screen should look something like this. It does not matter if yours look *exactly* like this; all that matters is that you have more than one track. ![A screencap of two music files, side-by-side.](https://github.com/wooster-core/Documentation/blob/master/images/image.audacity_twotracks.png)
2. Select where you would like the two tracks to meet up by click on the bottom track, where you would like the cursor to be. **Make sure both tracks (or however many tracks you want to align) have the cursor shown on them.** ![Screencap of the cursor, highlighted.](https://github.com/wooster-core/Documentation/blob/master/images/image.audacity_cursor_location.png)
3. Once you have the cursor where you would like it to go, click on **"Tracks" → "Align Tracks" → "Start to Cursor/Selection Start".** ![As seen here.](https://github.com/wooster-core/Documentation/blob/master/images/image.audacity_aligntracks.png)
4. *Voilà!* Your tracks are aligned. ![Aligned tracks.](https://github.com/wooster-core/Documentation/blob/master/images/image.audacity_alignedtracks.png)

#### To Check Your Editing/Changes
1. To test the changes you make to your audio, press the **green triangle/play button.** Play around with it as much as you want!
![Play button image.](https://github.com/wooster-core/Documentation/blob/master/images/image.audacity_button.play.png)
2. Once you are done editing your audio, either save or export it then __eject your flash drive.__ (More info on saving and exporting can be found in the [Expanded Tutorial.](https://github.com/wooster-core/Documentation/blob/master/SS:%20Expanded%20Audacity%20Tutorial.md)
5. You're done! __Don't forget to log out!__
