## Expanded Audacity Tutorial
### Using Audacity, but have some more questions that our last tutorial couldn't answer? We're here to help!

#### Recording with One or Two Microphones
In our basic tutorial, we went through how to record with three microphones at once. If you need one or two, here are tips for you. 

1. In the drop-down menu, select the number of microphones you will need.

2. Here is a diagram of our layout, along with each microphone's number:

3. On the mixer, take the knobs of the microphones you will not be using, and turn them all the way to the left.

Once done, please reset the mixer's dials to how they were when you first arrived.


#### More on Exporting & Saving
##### Export Directly to a .wav Audio File
1. If you do not have Audacity installed on your computer, or feel that your current recording is sufficient, press “File” in the top-left corner of the screen, in the top bar next to the Apple icon, then press “Export Audio”.

2. Save to whichever destination you would like. Name your file and select **.wav** as the file type.

##### If You Do Not Have a Flash Drive

1. Either save or export your file.
2. If you exported your file, save it either to a Cloud Provider or attach it to an email (file size permitting). 
3. If you chose to save your file as an .aup file, then take **the data folder and the .aup itself** and put them into your storage method of choice. <p><img src="https://github.com/wooster-core/Documentation/blob/master/images/image.audacity_saveaup4.png?raw=true"></p>
