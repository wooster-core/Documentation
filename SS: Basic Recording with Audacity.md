3. Click on the Audacity icon. If the icon is not there, or if Audacity did not open immediately, then open up Launchpad. <p><img src="http://www.technikblog.ch/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Launchpad-Icon.png" width = 100></p> You can find Audacity there in the list of apps.
4. When Audacity opens, make sure you have the following options selected in the dropdown menus. Note: If ‘Scarlett 18i8 USB’ is not an option in the second menu, make sure the mixer is powered on (switch on back, right).
