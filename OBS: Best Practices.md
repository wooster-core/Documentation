## Best Practices

### Attire
* Dress professionally. Overall professionalism in appearance will ensure that your viewers will be focused on the content of your presentation rather than your appearance.
* Avoid patterned clothing including pinstripes, herringbone, Scottish tweed, and small tight patterns.
* Avoid colors that highly contrast with your completion eg. Saturated red. 
* Avoid fabrics that make noise when they move or are pressed against a microphone (wool).
* Mid-range solids or subtle patterns, navy, soft non-textured fabrics are suitable for video.
* Don’t wear blue or green if you want to use the blue/green screen.
* Pay attention to details – make sure clothes are ironed, be careful with jewelry that might distract. 


### Appearance 
* Pay attention to makeup, ensuring that it is business/academic appropriate.
* Don’t wear too much makeup as the light tends to make you hot and you don’t want to be worrying about your makeup while working. 
* If your complexion shines or if you tend to sweat a lot, bring some tissues to blot or wear some light face powder.
The light does tend to wash out skin tones. Pretend you’re on stage and dress accordingly. 


### Speech
* Keep it simple. Don’t let a complicated presentation come in the way of conveying your point.
* Watch TED talks to get examples of how things might be said.
* Keep it coordinated. Coordinating your speech and the presentation helps it be more effective. 
* Be sure you have the right to use any third-party content that you want to add to your presentation.
* Give credit where credit is due.
* While writing the script, make sure it’s easy-going and friendly. 


### Presentation
* Using a presentations help convey your point clearly. Use Prezi or PowerPoint! 
* Don’t get too wordy. Don’t put too much information on your slides; make it concise. 
* Pick a side. While designing your presentation, make sure you know what side you wish to stand on (and it is comfortable) and * design your presentation around that.
* You should bring your own computer and connect it to the system to display your presentation. If you don’t know how to connect it, someone from the team will be there to help you.


### Recording
* Look directly into the camera keeping your gaze as steady as possible. Imagine you are speaking to someone as you record your video. Avoid allowing your eyes to dart quickly from place to place in the room. Relax! Natural blinking is fine.
Use good enunciation as you speak.
* Practice makes perfect! Use the One Button Studio to rehearse before you make your final recording. Endless re-dos on the same day might not improve your end product. Consider planning multiple practice sessions several days apart with viewing and practice in between.
* Shorter recordings are better. If you have a long presentation consider breaking it up into smaller standalone chunks that you can edit later. 3-5 minutes is optimum, no longer than 10 minutes when possible.


### Points to Remember:
* Schedule your timeslot way in advance because technology doesn’t always co operate. 
* Make sure you have everything you need on the day! 
* You will HAVE TO bring your own USB drive.
* Give yourself enough time before and after to make sure you’re not rushing yourself.
* If you do plan on moving stuff around, please return the room to its original layout before you leave. 
* Stick to your time slot. If you think you might require more time, let someone in the CoRE team know so they can help you out.
