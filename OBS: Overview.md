#### What is the One Button Studio? 
The OBS is a user-friendly way to practice, record or prepare for a presentation. 
* You can do this in 6 easy steps! 
* Walk over to CoRE in the library.
* Plug your USB drive into the recording computer. 
* Press the button to activate the lights and camera and start recording! 
* Give your presentation! 
* Press the button to STOP recording. 
* Press the button AGAIN, but this time for longer (about 2 seconds) to eject your pen drive.


**NOTE:** 
To record with the OBS, you will need to bring your own USB drive. To give you an idea of the size, 1GB records about 25 minutes of recording. It records in 1080p HD. 
When you are finished recording you will have an .mp4 file ready on your USB drive. This format plays on most devices and can be easily edited. Bring it over to the machines in digital studio and we can help you out!
