#### USB Drive
**I plugged in my USB Drive and nothing happened. I received an error message: “USB Drive not properly formatted”.** 
Check the format of your drive by right-clicking on the drive and selecting Get Info. If the format says FAT32 then *sigh*, the OBS is finicky. Try using another USB drive.  

USB drives must be formatted as FAT32 or HFS+ in order to be used with the One Button Studio. Other formats will not work. 
You can use the Mac computers outside in the digital studio to format your USB Drive. If you want to change the format of your USB drive, please visit http://qsee.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2560/~/mac%3A-how-to-format-a-flash-drive-to-fat32-in-mac-os-x for step by step instructions on how to do so. 

If it still doesn’t work, call the CoRE Consultants at 330-234-6564 or email us at core@wooster.edu.


**I plugged in my USB Drive and nothing happened. I received an error message: “USB Drive doesn’t have enough space”.**
Make more space on the USB drive or use a larger USB drive. This error will appear when there is less than 500 MB of free space on the USB drive. User should use a USB drive that either 
a) has more than 500 MB free or is 
b) bigger than 500 MB in total size when working with the One Button Studio.
Incase you don’t have a USB Drive, they are available at the Wilson Bookstore in Lowry Centre. 
*To give you an idea of the size, 1GB records about 25 minutes of recording. It records in 1080p HD.*


**Nothing happens when I plug the drive in.**
Ensure the USB drive isn’t defective by testing out using the Presentation computer. Many USB drives that are given away on campus and off are very cheaply made. These drives have been noted to have up to a 20% failure rate when working with the One Button Studio. In these cases, another USB drive is recommended.
 
 
 **There is no video on my USB Drive.**
 The USB drive was removed too early. When you are finished recording press the button and then wait for the computer prompt before you remove the USB drive.

#### Microphone
**I’m playing the video and it has no audio on this.**
Verify that the playback computer volume is audible.


**There is a hissing sound or noise on the video.**
Call the CoRE Consultants at 330-234-6564 or email us at core@wooster.edu.


**There is a delay in the audio.**
Avoid using Windows Media Player to play your video. Sound playback issues may be due to memory leakage in Windows. Reboot your computer or try playing the video with another application like VLC Media Player.
*You can find VLC on the computers across campus.*
Play video directly from the desktop instead of the USB drive. Sound playback issues may result from USB drives being too slow. This will manifest as video stuttering or appearing out of sync. Copy the .mp4 from the USB drive to the desktop and then open the .mp4 on the desktop.


#### Button
**Nothing happens when I press the button.**
Press the button firmly. Brand new buttons – or buttons that haven’t seen as much usage – may be slightly springier than older ones and the switch inside may not contact with the appropriate pressure. If the button light is on, press the button and hold it down for a slightly longer amount of time. In general, firmly press the button instead of lightly tapping it.


#### Camera
**The video is out of focus.**
Call the CoRE Consultants at 330-234-6564 or email them at core@wooster.edu.


**There is a delay in the video.**
While recording the video will appear on the recording monitor. It will look like there is a delay between what you doing in front of the camera and what is being recorded. This is the result of the encoding process the video goes through before being displayed on the recording monitor. This delay will not appear on the final .mp4 recording. 
If the problem persists in the final video, please call the CoRE Consultants at 33-234-6564 or email us at core@wooster.edu.


**I want to zoom in/out more.**
