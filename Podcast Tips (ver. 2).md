- **Go in with a plan.** While sometimes, you can strike gold with a podcast idea on the fly, it’s really hard to do that and have it sound professional.
- **Write a script or outline.** No matter how good you are at improv, an outline really makes the process easier!
- **Make sure that you have enough microphones!** If you have 2 speakers, use a microphone for each. It will create a different audio track, but trust me. It’s worth it because it makes editing easier.
- **You can do multiple takes!** Podcasts aren’t a “one and done” kind of deal. You can edit together the best parts.
- **If you want, you can upload them to iTunes and other sources.** There will be a tutorial about this soon!
- **Make sure to enunciate.** This will help listeners understand you!
- **Don’t forget to stand close to the microphone!** Otherwise, these microphones will not pick up your voice, which is a slight issue for a podcast.
- **Headphones are also good to use.** When playing back, they allow for better audio quality.
- **Make sure to record 30 or so seconds of blank audio before starting.** That way, you can remove the ambient noise of the room once you’re done recording, and have clearer audio.
