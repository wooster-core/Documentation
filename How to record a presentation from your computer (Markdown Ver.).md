1. Check out cables (VGA cable or HDMI cable) and a dongle for a Mac computer from the Andrews circulation desk.
2. Insert the cable into the dongle on one end and plug the dongle into your computer.
3. Plug the other end of the cable into the wall plate.
4. Press the ‘on’ button to turn on the projector. **Give it a couple minutes to turn on!**
5. If you are using VGA, press the computer sign on the plate to get your computer screen on display.
6. If you are using an HDMI cable, press the HDMI sign to get your screen.
7. You can check out a slide advancer from the circulation desk as well. 
8. Use zoom in and out on the camera remote to get an optimum angle for you recording.
9. Be cautious of where you are standing when presenting.
10. Talk and look at the camera when recording. 
11. Be careful with how you design your slides, based on where you want to be in the frame when filming.
