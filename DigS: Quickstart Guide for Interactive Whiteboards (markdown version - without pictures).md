5. In order to change these settings:
6. When the Interactive Whiteboard's pen color menu appears (tap the screen with either your finger or one of the Whiteboard pens), select a color on the side of the screen using the tool you want to change. (For example, if you want the blue pen to be an eraser instead, using the blue pen, select the eraser tool.)
